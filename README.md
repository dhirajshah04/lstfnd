<center><h1> Lost Found </h1></center>
<p> The idea behind the <strong>Lost Found</strong> is very simple.
Recently in my country Nepal, I have found that people started posting on facebook if they have lost any of their things like wallet, money, documents etc. Even missing person is shared on
facebook for help. It's a good way to get help and help others but it has a limitation too and that is not eveyone can see evey <i>Help Post</i> so to overcome that limitation, <i>Lost Found </i> is initiated. </P>
